...

## Introduction to Jest
### Introduction
- Jest team includes members from the React team

### The Jest Testing Ecosystem
- Enzyme is another test tool and can be used with Jest
- test runner organises tests into "describe" and "it" blocks
- Jest is built on top of Jasmine and Mocha
- Jest adds snapshot testing, mocking and other features
- Jest adds a superior assertion library and CLI
- Enzyme (from AirBnb) expresses component output as HTML (like React Test Renderer)

### Jest vs. Mocha
- Both test runners
- Both can run asynchronous tests
- Jest includes spies, snapshot testing and module mocking
