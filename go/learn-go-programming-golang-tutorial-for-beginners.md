## Variables
- variable declaration and initialisation options
- function vs package variables
- cannot redeclare variables within the same scope (however variable shadowing is possible)
- cannot declare unused variables - results in a compiler error
- variable naming - lowercase first letter scoped to package, uppercase first letter visible outside of package
- variable naming convention - short-lived variables tend to have short names; longer-lived longer, more descriptive names; acronyms are all in uppercase
- explicit type conversion functions, **NB. int to string conversions are done using functions in the `strconv` package**. `string(anIntVariable)` will encode the stream of bytes to their Unicode characters which typically is not what is intended
